* `timedifference` : Used to 'humanize' datetime formats quickly, since we used a lot throughout our app
* `rqrcode` : Used to generate QR codes for the restaurants
* `chunky_png` : Used for the read/write access of the PNG files. It is used to output the QR code generated by rqrcode as a png image 

## Testing
Testing is done with cucumber and capybara, we are testing 2 scenarios for now:
* User is logged in and can create a restaurant
* User can queue for a restaurant, create a new table in the restaurant and set him/herself to that table

## Useful Tools

* `Gitleaks` : Gitleaks is used to detect and secure the exposed sensitive information such as secret keys, database passwords, ssh keys and other sensitive information in repositories

## Problem Sets Documentation

* All the problem sets documentations have been added into the Problem Set Documentation folder in pdf format
